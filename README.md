# Economy_agent
## Use the 1960_owrd data with Ai Agent

## Eplanation:
**Kafka Consumer and Producer:** Messages are consumed from input_topic and after processing, 
results are published to output_topic. 
Errors are logged to error_topic.

Backoff Retry: The backoff_retry decorator applies retry logic with exponential backoff 
for the process_message function, 
allowing for transient failures without immediately escalating to an error state.

Error Handling: If an error occurs during processing, it's caught, and the error 
details along with the original message are 
sent to an error topic for later inspection or manual intervention.

Pipeline Structure: The main_pipeline function represents the core of our data pipeline, 
continuously pulling data from Kafka, 
processing it, and sending it back or to an error queue.

Graceful Shutdown: The script listens for a KeyboardInterrupt to allow for graceful shutdown, 
where the producer flushes any remaining messages.


Here's how you can run a Python script depending on your environment:

Running a Python Script in Command Line
Ensure Python is Installed:
Check if Python is installed by opening your command line or terminal and typing:
bash
`python --version`
Or for Python 3 specifically:
bash
`python3 --version`
If Python isn't installed, download and install it from python.org.
Navigate to Your Script's Directory:
Use the cd command to change directory to where your script is located. For example:
bash
`cd /path/to/your/script/directory`
Run the Script:
If your script is named `script.py`, you can run it with:
bash
`python script.py`
Or if you're using Python 3 specifically:
bash
`python3 script.py`

Running with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Using PyCharm, VSCode, or similar:

PyCharm:
Open the project containing your script.
Right-click on your script in the Project pane.
Choose "Run `'script.py`'" from the context menu or use the play button at the top right.
Visual Studio Code:
Open the folder containing your script.
Open the script file.
Either:
Click the 'Run Code' button (if you have the Code Runner extension).
Use F5 to start debugging which will run the script.
Right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal".

Running as a Module
If your script is part of a package or you've set up`__main__.py`:

bash
`python -m your_package_name`

Running with Shebang (Unix-like systems)
If your script starts with a shebang line like `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, 
you can make it executable:
bash
`chmod +x script.py`
Then you can run it directly:
bash
`./script.py`

Running in Jupyter Notebooks

If you're working with Jupyter for interactive Python sessions:
Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Navigate to the directory containing your script.

You can either:
Convert your script to a notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook script.py` then open the resulting notebook.
Or, directly run your script using `%run script.py` in a notebook cell.

Notes:
Virtual Environments: If you're using Python virtual environments, 
make sure to activate your environment before running the script:

bash
`source venv/bin/activate`  # On Unix or MacOS
`.\venv\Scripts\activate`  # On Windows


Dependencies: Ensure all required modules are installed (`pip install module_name`) 
or listed in a requirements.txt which you can install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


Environment Variables: If your script depends on environment variables, 
set them before running or use a `.env` file with a library like `python-dotenv`.

By following these steps, you should be able to execute your Python script in various environments.
